"""Create a connection to MongoDB as a global module used in SCOOP-based parallel applications

    Note that, this is a temporary and not elegant solution.
      Before running such applications such as scenarios_analysis/spatialunits/main_nsga2.py,
      users MUST update the host and port manually.

    References:
        Explicit access to module level variables by accessing them explicitly on the module.
