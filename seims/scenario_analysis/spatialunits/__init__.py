Spatial optimization of watershed BMPs based on different spatial configuration units,

   currently supported:

   - Common units such as Hydrologic response units (HRUs) and explicitly HRUs (e.g., farm units)
   - Hydrologically connected fields (Wu et al., 2018)
   - Slope position units (Qin et al., 2018)
   - Boundary-adaptive slope position units (Zhu et al., 2020)
